# iF â€” login and join the fun

Welcome to our open source Android app! "iF" is a convenient event management app, although is still a prototype, it's main functionality is implemented. 

"iF" helps event creator manage their events as well as check event participants information online. For the participants, they can search nearby events, search events in a particular area or search by both category and area (You can be both event creator and participant). All participants can only login through their Google account so far, when loign completed, users can change their nick name, gender, avatar and more public and private info.

For convenience, we used some open source libraries, they look like this in graddle:
```
implementation 'de.hdodenhof:circleimageview:2.2.0'
implementation 'com.github.yalantis:ucrop:2.2.2'
implementation 'com.fxn769:pix:1.2.5'
```
The instruction of these libraries can be found here:

We used google Api client and firebase to support some functions in our app.
